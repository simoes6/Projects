The even, flat surface reduces the risk of tripping and helps maintain a consistent pace.

Develop a training schedule that accommodates everyone's fitness levels and availability. Tools like shared calendars or apps can help keep everyone on track.

## Benefits

Running offers a multitude of benefits for both physical and mental health.

Running strengthens the heart and improves circulation, reducing the risk of heart disease.

Whether you're running for fitness, mental health, or social reasons, the benefits are extensive and can contribute to a healthier, happier life.

Not having a running buddy or support system can make it harder to stay committed.

Fitting running into a social schedule can sometimes be tricky, especially if friends or family are not supportive of your running goals

By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, you can create a more sustainable and enjoyable running routine.
