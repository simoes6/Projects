### Project Overview
I have developed a comprehensive running website aimed at connecting fellow runners and discovering the best running trails in your vicinity. The website also features articles written by top Irish athletes. When users click on a blog post or an athlete's name, they are directed to a dedicated landing page with more detailed information. Additionally, users can subscribe to a newsletter, send emails, and access login and connection pages.
### Instructions
The objective of this assignment is to showcase how you apply course concepts, models, tools, and practices in your work to meet the course learning outcomes:
- Write clean and efficient HTML and CSS code.
- Create web page layouts and styling that meet customer requirements.
- Apply interactivity to a web page using JavaScript.
- Utilize Bootstrap and similar web design aids.
- Incorporate content/data from third-party REST APIs using AJAX.
- Design, construct, and deploy real-world static responsive websites.
### Objective
Develop a fully-featured website using Astro and optionally Svelte, incorporating a functional feature from the ideas below or a feature of your own. The key is to ensure proper integration between the frontend and the website content, integration with third-party APIs, and deploy the application while demonstrating strong communication and software engineering best practices.
